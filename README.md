# Swift WAMP

Swift wamp is a [Web Application Messaging Protocal](https://wamp-proto.org/) implementation in Swift.

This package is based on [iscriptology/swamp](https://github.com/iscriptology/swamp) which is no longer being maintained and no longer compatable with Swift 5.

It currently supports calling remote procedures, subscribing on topics, and publishing events. It also supports authentication using ticket & wampcra authentication.

Swamp utilizes WebSockets as its only available transport, and JSON as its serialization method.

Contributions to support MessagePack & Raw Sockets will be merged gladly!

## Swift Versions

| Swift Version | Swamp Version   | Requirements         |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 2.x           | 0.1.x           | OSX 10.9 or iOS 8.0  |
| 3             | 0.2.0 and above | OSX 10.10 or iOS 8.0 |

## Installation
### cocoapods
To use Swamp through cocoapods, add

```ruby
pod 'Swamp', '~> 0.2.0'
```

to your Podfile. (use `'~> 0.1.0'` for Swift 2)

### Swift Package Manager
To use Swamp through Swift Package Manager, create a Package.swift file:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SwampTestProject",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/RadarBee/swamp.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 2)
    ]
)
```

`$ swift build`

## Usage
#### Connect to router

```swift
import Swamp

let swampTransport = WebSocketSwampTransport(wsEndpoint:  NSURL(string: "ws://my-router.com:8080/ws")!)
let swampSession = SwampSession(realm: "router-defined-realm", transport: swampTransport)
// Set delegate for callbacks
// swampSession.delegate = <SwampSessionDelegate implementation>
swampSession.connect()
swampSession.disconnect()
```
##### SwampSession constructor parameters
* `realm` - which realm to join
* `transport` - a `SwampTransport` implementation
* `authmethods` `authid` `authrole` `authextra` - See your router's documentation and use accordingly

##### Connection/Disconnection
* `connect()` - Establish transport and perform authentication if configured.
* `disconnect()` - Opposite.

Now you should wait for your delegate's callbacks:

##### SwampSessionDelegate interface
Implement the following methods:

* `func swampSessionHandleChallenge(authMethod: String, extra: [String: AnyObject]) -> String`
  * Fired when a challenge request arrives.
  * You can `return SwampCraAuthHelper.sign("your-secret", extra["challenge"] as! String)` to support `wampcra` auth method.
* `func swampSessionConnected(session: SwampSession, sessionId: Int)`
 * Fired once the session has established and authenticated a session, and has joined the realm successfully. (AKA You may now call, subscribe & publish.)
* `func swampSessionEnded(reason: String)`
 * Fired once the connection has ended. 
 * `reason` is usually a WAMP-domain error, but it can also be a textual description of WTF just happened 

#### Let's get the shit started!
* **General note: Lots of callback functions receive args-kwargs pairs, check your other client implementaion to see which of them is utilized, and act accordingly.**

##### Calling remote procedures
Calling may fire two callbacks:

* `onSuccess` - if calling has completed without errors.
* `onError` - If the call has failed. (Either in router or in peer client.)

###### Signature
```swift
public func call(proc: String, options: [String: AnyObject]=[:], args: [AnyObject]?=nil, kwargs: [String: AnyObject]?=nil, onSuccess: CallCallback, onError: ErrorCallCallback)
```

###### Simple use case:
```swift
session.call("wamp.procedure", args: [1, "argument1"],
    onSuccess: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Usually result is in results[0], but do a manual check in your infrastructure
    },
    onError: { details, error, args, kwargs in
        // Handle your error here (You can ignore args kwargs in most cases)
    })
```

###### Full use case:
```swift
session.call("wamp.procedure", options: ["disclose_me": true], args: [1, "argument1"], kwargs: ["arg1": 1, "arg2": "argument2"], 
    onSuccess: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Usually result is in results[0], but do a manual check in your infrastructure
    },
    onError: { details, error, args, kwargs in
        // Handle your error here (You can ignore args kwargs in most cases)
    })
```

##### Subscribing on topics
Subscribing may fire three callbacks:

* `onSuccess` - if subscription has succeeded.
* `onError` - if it has not.
* `onEvent` - if it succeeded, this is fired when the actual event was published.

###### Signature
```swift
public func subscribe(topic: String, options: [String: AnyObject]=[:], onSuccess: SubscribeCallback, onError: ErrorSubscribeCallback, onEvent: EventCallback)
```

###### Simple use case:
```swift
session.subscribe("wamp.topic", onSuccess: { subscription in 
    // subscription can be stored for subscription.cancel()
    }, onError: { details, error in
                                
    }, onEvent: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Event data is usually in results, but manually check blabla yadayada
    })
```

###### Full use case:
```swift
session.subscribe("wamp.topic", options: ["disclose_me": true], 
    onSuccess: { subscription in 
        // subscription can be stored for subscription.cancel()
    }, onError: { details, error in
        // handle error                        
    }, onEvent: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Event data is usually in results, but manually check blabla yadayada
    })
```

##### Publishing events
Publishing may either be called without callbacks (AKA unacknowledged) or with the following two callbacks:

* `onSuccess` - if publishing has succeeded.
* `onError` - if it has not.

###### Signature
```swift
// without acknowledging
public func publish(topic: String, options: [String: AnyObject]=[:], args: [AnyObject]?=nil, kwargs: [String: AnyObject]?=nil)
// with acknowledging
public func publish(topic: String, options: [String: AnyObject]=[:], args: [AnyObject]?=nil, kwargs: [String: AnyObject]?=nil, onSuccess: PublishCallback, onError: ErrorPublishCallback) {
```

###### Simple use case:
```swift
session.publish("wamp.topic", args: [1, "argument2"])
```
###### Full use case:
```swift
session.publish("wamp.topic", options: ["disclose_me": true],  args: [1, "argument2"], kwargs: ["arg1": 1, "arg2": "argument2"],
    onSuccess: {
        // Publication has been published!
    }, onError: { details, error in
        // Handle error (What can it be except wamp.error.not_authorized?)
    })
```

## Testing
For now, only integration tests against crossbar exist. I plan to add unit tests in the future.

In order to run the tests:

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) (Easy Peasy)
2. Open `Example/Swamp.xcworkspace` with XCode
3. Select `Swamp_Test-iOS` or `Swamp_Test-OSX`
4. Run the tests! (`Product -> Test` or âŒ˜U)

### Troubleshooting
If for some reason the tests fail, make sure:

* You have docker installed and available at `/usr/local/bin/docker`
* You have an available port 8080 on your machine

You can also inspect `Example/swamp-crossbar-instance.log` to find out what happened with the crossbar instance while the tests were executing.

## Roadmap
1. MessagePack & Raw Sockets
2. Callee role
3. More robust codebase and error handling
4. More generic and comfortable API
5. Advanced profile features

I don't care, MIT because it's `pod lib create` default and I'm too lazy to [tldrlegal](https://tldrlegal.com).
